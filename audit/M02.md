# RubiconMarket: buy() may not take any fee for tokens with low decimal precision

## Impact

In the `buy` function of the RubiconMarket contract, a fee is subtracted on taker trades.
The default `feeBPS` is set to `1` which is equivalent to a fee of `0.01%` or `0.0001` in decimal form.

For tokens like gUSD with a low decimal precision of [2](https://etherscan.io/token/0x056fd409e1d7a124bd7017459dfea2f387b6d5cd), no fees will be taken on 3 figure trades since Solidity will round down the result to 0.

## Proof of Concept

The taker fee is calculated in the `buy` function of the RubiconMarket contract on [L338](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-04-rubicon/blob/511636d889742296a54392875a35e4c0c4727bb7/contracts/RubiconMarket.sol#L338) and also in the `calcAmountAfterFee` function on [L583](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-04-rubicon/blob/511636d889742296a54392875a35e4c0c4727bb7/contracts/RubiconMarket.sol#L583).

The following reasoning also apply to the maker fee on [L346](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-04-rubicon/blob/511636d889742296a54392875a35e4c0c4727bb7/contracts/RubiconMarket.sol#L346) and [L586](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-04-rubicon/blob/511636d889742296a54392875a35e4c0c4727bb7/contracts/RubiconMarket.sol#L586).

Let's take for example a 500 gUSD trade, mathematically the fee would be:
`500 * 0.0001 = 0.05`

In solidity, for a token with 2 decimal places, we would get:
`amount * feeBPS / 100_000 = 50000 * 1 / 100_000 = 0` cause it rounds down to 0.

It would allow a user to not pay any taker and/or maker fee on 3 figure trades.

## Tools Used

Foundry unit test available here: https://github.com/PierrickGT/2023-04-rubicon/blob/b57d4deac109dc677eafd171b69540c534f24563/test/audit-tests/Audit.t.sol#L165

## Recommended Mitigation Steps

You could either not support these type of tokens or add the following requires.

Add `require(fee != 0)` to the `buy` function after calculating the fee on [L338](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-04-rubicon/blob/511636d889742296a54392875a35e4c0c4727bb7/contracts/RubiconMarket.sol#L338) of the RubiconMarket contract.

Add the same kind of require for the `makerFee` after [L346](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-04-rubicon/blob/511636d889742296a54392875a35e4c0c4727bb7/contracts/RubiconMarket.sol#L346).

And also add the same kind of require in the `calcAmountAfterFee` function after [L583](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-04-rubicon/blob/511636d889742296a54392875a35e4c0c4727bb7/contracts/RubiconMarket.sol#L583).
