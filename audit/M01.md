# RubiconMarket: offer() accounting should be performed after transferring tokens

## Impact

In the `offer` function of the RubiconMarket contract, any type of ERC20 tokens is accepted.
The `pay_amt` being recorded in `info` is the `pay_amt` passed to the `offer` function and not the actual amount of tokens that were transferred to the Market contract.
This approach does not support fee on transfer tokens and unfulfillable orders could be created.

## Proof of Concept

Let's take for example a fee on transfer token that takes a 10% fee each time a transfer occurs.

Alice creates two orders using this token and expects to receive `TUSDC` tokens in return:
```
uint256 payAmount = 1000e18;
uint256 buyAmount = 1000e6;

uint256 offerOneId = market.offer(payAmount, ERC20(address(feeOnTransferToken)), buyAmount, TUSDC, alice, alice);
uint256 offerTwoId = market.offer(payAmount, ERC20(address(feeOnTransferToken)), buyAmount, TUSDC, alice, alice);
```

Since this fee on transfer token takes a 10% fee, only 1800 tokens, out of the 2000 tokens, are actually transferred to the Market contract.

Since the offer is created by storing the passed `pay_amt` into `info`: [info.pay_amt = pay_amt;](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-04-rubicon/blob/511636d889742296a54392875a35e4c0c4727bb7/contracts/RubiconMarket.sol#L528)
Each offer is actually backed by 900 tokens instead of the recorded `pay_amt` of 1000 tokens.

Then Bob decides to fulfill both offers and creates a first buy order that is successful:
```
uint256 payAmount = 1000e18;
TUSDC.approve(address(market), type(uint256).max);
market.buy(offerOneId, payAmount);
```

Bob then decides to fulfill the second offer and creates a second buy order:
```
market.buy(offerTwoId, payAmount);
```

Unfortunately, this buy order will be unsuccessful since only 800 tokens are left in the market contract instead of the 1000 tokens requested and recorded in `info.buy_amt`.

I've labeled this issue as medium cause only the last recorded offer would not be fulfillable and the front-end would not list this type of assets, so the risk is medium.

## Tools Used

Foundry unit test available here: https://github.com/PierrickGT/2023-04-rubicon/blob/9f11fa8fe01610a922525cb5656c4018ef95b36d/test/audit-tests/Audit.t.sol#L115

## Recommended Mitigation Steps

The `pay_gem` balance should be recorded before and after performing the transfer.
The difference in balance will be the actual amount transferred to the market contract and recorded in `info.pay_amt`.

To avoid polluting the order book with unfulfillable orders, the function should revert if the amount transferred is equal to 0.

Recommended implementation:

```
  uint256 payAmtBalanceBefore = pay_gem.balanceOf(address(this));

  require(pay_gem.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), pay_amt));

  uint256 payAmt = pay_gem.balanceOf(address(this)) - payAmtBalanceBefore;

  require(payAmt != 0);

  OfferInfo memory info;
  info.pay_amt = payAmt;
  info.pay_gem = pay_gem;
  info.buy_amt = buy_amt;
  info.buy_gem = buy_gem;
  info.recipient = recipient;
  info.owner = owner;
  info.timestamp = uint64(block.timestamp);
  id = _next_id();
  offers[id] = info;
```
